Hello, this is Reaseason, you can also call me David :D!
I'm a undergraduated school student, and major in information and financial management in Taiwan.
I'm interested in some specific kinds of software to solve problems I am facing in the real world.
So, This is a palace where I upload a few interesting side projects used by python and java.
I'm still a student and I'm willing to learn everything I am excited about.
Wish I could hear your comment if there would be some mistake in my codes.
Thanks :)
